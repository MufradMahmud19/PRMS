## Meeting 3.
* **DATE: 20.03.2025**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### 30 Minutes
*In the meeting, we discussed the missing elements in our Deliverable 3 submission. The resource table in the wiki was not included, which cost us a point. While our implementation of addressability and statelessness was acceptable, the uniform interface was only partially correctâ€”using dict.update() does not fully meet RESTful PUT standards unless all fields are validated. Assistants also noted that our test coverage was insufficient, and there were issues with project structure and deployment clarity.*

### Action points
*We need to add the missing resource table to the wiki and update the PUT implementation to ensure full field validation. Each sub-service should be moved to its own repository to improve modularity. The README must be updated to include detailed instructions, especially status codes for POST and PUT. We also need to demonstrate schema validation clearly, implement basic caching and authentication features, and ensure the test suite is working and covers all major functionality.*
