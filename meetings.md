## Meeting 3.
* **DATE: 20.03.2025**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### 30 Minutes
*During the meeting, we reviewed the shortcomings in our Deliverable 3 submission. It was noted that the resource table was missing from the project wiki, resulting in a point deduction. While the implementation of addressability and statelessness was deemed acceptable, our use of dict.update() for PUT requests was flagged as insufficient. It does not fully adhere to RESTful principles unless all fields are properly validated. Additionally, the assistants highlighted concerns regarding insufficient test coverage, unclear project structure, and deployment instructions.*

### Action points
*- Add the missing resource table to the project wiki.

- Refactor the PUT implementation to validate all fields, ensuring compliance with RESTful standards.

- Separate each sub-service into its own repository to improve modularity and maintainability.

- Update the README to include clear deployment instructions and specify status codes for POST and PUT operations.

- Demonstrate schema validation clearly within the codebase or documentation.

- Implement basic caching and authentication features.

- Fix and expand the test suite to ensure it covers all major functionality and passes consistently.*


## Meeting 4.
* **DATE: 23.04.2025**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### 20 Minutes

*The meeting focused on reviewing the current progress and evaluation of documentation, hypermedia design, and implementation. It was noted that:
- The API documentation is not yet available, resulting in a score of zero across all documentation-related categories.

- The Hypermedia Design section received partial credit. The state diagram needs refinement, specifically to ensure all endpoints are represented and connected. Custom link relations were minimally addressed.

- The Hypermedia Implementation is partially complete. Some control implementations are missing, there are issues with JWT-related test failures, and the system has not reached full feature parity with the design.

- Overall score: 3.5/16, indicating significant areas for improvement, especially in documentation and full control implementation.*

### Action points

*1. Create and complete API documentation, including:

- Structure and detailed endpoint descriptions

- Request bodies and response examples

- HTTP status/response codes

2. Improve the hypermedia state diagram:

- Ensure it reflects all available endpoints

- Show clear connectedness between states

- Implement missing hypermedia controls for all resources.

- Resolve JWT-related test failures to improve testing reliability and coverage.

- Align link relations in implementation with those described in the design phase.*
